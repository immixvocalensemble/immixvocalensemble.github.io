# immixvocalensemble.github.io
Website for Immix Vocal Ensemble.
Based very loosely on the [Scribble theme](https://github.com/muan/scribble). Better to say that was the starting point at some point in time.

Other code sources glued together in a Frankensteinesque manner:

- [This blog post](https://forestry.io/blog/creating-a-multilingual-blog-with-jekyll/) for the bilingual part of the site
- [Staticman v3](https://git.io/smdemo) for comments 
- [This blog post](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/) for a pluginless method to get blog tags (doesn't work too well with the bilingual part but I can live with that)

Site uses as little Javascript as possible, mostly HTML and CSS using [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/).
