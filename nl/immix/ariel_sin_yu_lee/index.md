> **What is your artistic training and background?**

- I started my musical training first as a flutist when I was 12. The wind orchestra of my school was quite established and often participated in competitions, music festivals in Hong Kong and abroad. Then I studied my bachelors in music study with a major in flute in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I played in different wind orchestras, orchestras and chamber concerts in Hong Kong.
- In the 2nd year of my bachelors study, I started taking singing lessons as a second subject. It was just for fun at the beginning, as I always liked singing and I wanted to sing better. Then with time, my passion on singing grew stronger and stronger. I started to sing in different vocal groups, choirs and concerts in Hong Kong. I also got opportunities to make my opera debut and oratorio debut as a soloist before I left for the Netherlands.
- Under the encouragement of my previous singing teacher in Hong Kong, I auditioned for HKU Utrechts Conservatorium in 2017 and started my masters of singing study in the same year.

> **What is you most memorable artistic experience?**

NKK NXT is my most memorable artistic experience so far, I have learnt so much in this programme on singing, music, theater, production, PR, programming, communication and team work. It is a lot of work but also a lot of fun to create a production together from scratch. 
    
During the process, I also got to know myself better and found that I am more capable than I thought. 

- tango concerts with Eduardo Tami 
- improvisation with Laye and Ibou etc 
- my opera debut with Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, first time working professionally 
- my oratorio debut with Cantabile “Messiah” in Hong Kong in 2017, first time singing with an orchestra, we have to sing all choral parts and solo parts by ourselves as a chamber choir from memory 

> **Immix Vocal Ensemble sprung out from NKK NXT, a traineeship organized by the Nederlands Kamerkoor where young singers explore what choir singing is about by creating and producing their own performance. Why did you want to be a part of this program?**

- The advertisement of this programme was really appealing to me, as I am very interested in learning more about theater making and ensemble singing. I wanted to create a musical theater piece of good intentions with other artistis. I believe that arts is not just for the sake for arts, but to serve humanity. 

- I also found it a good challenge for myself as I had never tried performing in nor making choral music theater productions. I also did not have a lot of ensemble singing experience. I believe that I could have a lot of personal growth by stepping out of my comfort zone. 

> **What is your superpower in Immix Vocal Ensemble?**

Being a lucky star and making everyone sing in Chinese.
