<p class="f6 lh-copy eindexamen overflow-auto">
Lies and truth denied, 
to prove our pride, 
guide our game 
Lies and truth denied, 
to smooth the sides,  
hide our shame<br>
In fear, who’ll understand? 
One wonders; ‘who is foe? who is friend?’          
that record plays all over again 
Woman nor man can mend…<br>
Lies and truth denied, 
to separate and divide  <br>
One look, but none who see
Staring blind in bright L.E.D. 
There’s no connection		
How could there be?
Just let it be!			Please, be!<br>
When we don’t see,   		
It seems that we         	
in our anguish              	
are blinding the eye   	
to what could be.       <br>	
Opening eyes, 
So much we can realise
When we see!	<br>
Much as fright begs 
the body to fight or flee				
From heart to heart to heart to heart, flow!	 
From heart to heart to heart to heart, know!<br>
There lies truth
In the branch of an olive tree
From heart to heart to heart to heart, see!
From heart to heart to heart to heart, be!
Steadily, show me…<br>
When we don’t see,   
It seems that we     
in our anguish              
are blinding the eye   
to what could be.  <br>
Mirrors in us call
Can we look at our reflection?
We all must take action
You see
To avoid the debris<br>
Open eyes.
Realise and see.<br>
On Common ground
Once found
There’s a space 
Where all of us can be
Where you and me are we

#### James MacMillan ⁠— _O Radiant Dawn_

<p class="f6 lh-copy eindexamen overflow-auto">
O Radiant Dawn,
Splendour of eternal Light,
Sun of Justice: come,
Shine on those who dwell in darkness
And the shadow of death.
Isaiah had prophesied, 
'The people who walked in darkness
have seen a  great light:
Upon those who dwelt in the land of gloom
a light has shone.'
Amen.

Ave verum Corpus, natum

De Maria Virgine,

Vere passum, immolatum

In cruce pro homine,
    <i>on the cross for mankind,</i>
Cuius latus perforatum

Unda fluxit sanguine:

Esto nobis praegustatum

In mortis examine.

<p class="f6 lh-copy eindexamen overflow-auto">
Now
Here
This moment only
You and I
Here and now<br>
Take them
These words into the ear
Thus moves thought to word
Through sou.n.d.
Be enchanted
Like a child who in a seashell newly found 
discovers the ever-sounding sea.<br>
Breath with me
Here and now
Out and in
And out
Thus begins on breath's rhythm a new sentence 
again and again
Here out
Now in<br>
My lips feel tight, a box
She shifts, minus, plus
Registers in one, in nill
Nill, one, one, nill
Pulsates them through the cable
Enwaves them through the air
Over cities over countryside
Through ocean's deepest depths 
'till 'yond the moon and back
The whole world she brings thus to your home
Where, through tube and thread 
and the so called "speaker", 
she deposits the words 
in the little shells of your ears
Back to you
Here and now<br>
I am happy you are listening.<br>
Through your head, through your throat
Through our chest, belly and legs
With your feet planted on the ground
Into the deepest part of your toes
These series of pulses
These waves through the air
Find their way back into the earth 
on which I stand
Wherefrom this sounds...<br>
When I can feel your touch once more
And see you not in pixels but 
by light of moon or sun
I will go back
Out and in
Here and now
to where all had begun

Cooperation, always looking for artistic urgency and a broad musical and artistic orientation. Those are the most important characteristics of Merel Wentink.<br><br>
Merel is artistically strongest when collaborating closely with others. This is visible in her career as mezzo soprano. Apart from being involved with NKK NXT 20/21 (Immix) Merel is singing with Trio Ridente. This is an ensemble she set up in 2019, together with Meike Wijma (soprano) and Julia Hoorman (piano). Trio Ridente interprets songs and duets from different styles and combines them with up-to-date topics, text and theatre.<br><br>
From the beginning of her classical singing studies at the conservatory in Groningen, Merel has been interested in projects with a certain societal and artistic urgency. Next to gaining experience as a soloist in oratoria (Bach's Matthew Passion, Mendelssohn's Elias, Mozart's Requiem), she searched for this urgency in several productions within the Opera Forward Festival and an internship at Holland Opera. In these projects she collaborated with multiple contemporary composers and experimented with different acting styles. <br><br>
In her collaboration with The Skypainters (a modern jazz collective with classical influences) and with Wende Snijders in her show ‘De Wildernis’, she enriched her repertoire by getting a taste of cross-over styles with non-classical music.
