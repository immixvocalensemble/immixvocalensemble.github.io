> **What is your artistic training and background?**

I have been singing in ensembles since I was very young, I received my Bachelors in Music from Royal Holloway University of London and my Classical Performance Masters from The Royal
Conservatoire in The Hague. I’ve also toured all over Europe, North America and Canada both as a soloist and in Ensembles.<br><br>

> **What is you most memorable artistic experience?**

One of my most memorable artistic experiences is having the honour of performing at the Royal
Albert Hall as part of the Festival of Remembrance for the Royal British Legion.<br><br>

> **Immix Vocal Ensemble sprung out from NKK NXT, a traineeship organized by the Nederlands Kamerkoor where young singers explore what choir singing is about by creating and producing their own performance. Why did you want to be a part of this program?**
 
To perform alongside some of the most prestigious artists in the UK in a revered venue for and important day to millions of viewers worldwide was an unforgettable experience.
I wanted to become a member of the NKK NXT scheme to take on the challenge of creating a new
ensemble and production from beginning to completion of the performance. To broaden my
horizons and work in a co-operative in an ensemble setting. To have complete creative control over the project and work outside my comfort zone.<br><br>

> **What is your superpower in Immix Vocal Ensemble?**

My super power in the IMMIX Vocal Ensemble is that I’m a walking talking library! I love to write and prepare concert programmes so I have a piece for every occasion!
