> **What is your artistic training and background?**

After a brief detour into European politics, I started training to become a musical theater performer. I followed the MusicAllFactory in Tilburg, the Meisner Toneelacademie in Den Bosch and finally a master of music  for music theatre at the Fontys Hogeschool voor de Kunsten.

> **What is you most memorable artistic experience?**

Besides being part of NKKNXT. I remember creating a weekly murder series at primary school. My first artistic creation however, was a silent film adaptation of Euripidesâ€™ Bacchae. Also creating a music theatre film for my Master exam, because audience was banned due to Covid, was a memorable and ultimately highly enjoyable and rewarding experience.

> **Immix Vocal Ensemble sprung out from NKK NXT, a traineeship organized by the Nederlands Kamerkoor where young singers explore what choir singing is about by creating and producing their own performance. Why did you want to be a part of this program?**

For me as person with a music theatre background who has been dabbling with more classical repertoire, the opportunity to work musically on such a high level was very enticing. Additionally the chance to make our own performance and really work as a group on a project made me eager to be part of this experience.

> **What is your superpower in Immix Vocal Ensemble?**

Normally I am not one to write in terms of superpowers. But I like to think that my writing has been helpful in the process. As well as the ability to keep track of things productionally, and my creative thinking. The fact that we all have are strong suits and are allowed to contribute is exactly what makes IMMIX such a great ensemble to be part of.
