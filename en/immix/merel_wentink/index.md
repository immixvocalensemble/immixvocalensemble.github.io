> **What is your artistic training and background?**

Iâ€™m trained as a classical singer and as a music teacher.<br><br>

> **What is you most memorable artistic experience?**

During my studies I had the dream to become an opera singer. At some point I got invited to sing a contemporary short opera about Atlantis. I was the princess of Atlantis who was coming to earth to warn the audience about climate change. I had to sing everything in the opera gurgling, because that was the Atlantis language.<br><br>

> **Immix Vocal Ensemble sprung out from NKK NXT, a traineeship organized by the Nederlands Kamerkoor where young singers explore what choir singing is about by creating and producing their own performance. Why did you want to be a part of this program?**

I wanted to learn how to make a performance from scratch; to not only study the music and sing, but also to think about artistic content and production.<br><br>

> **What is your superpower in Immix Vocal Ensemble?**

To try to be always true to the story I find important to tell in a performance.
