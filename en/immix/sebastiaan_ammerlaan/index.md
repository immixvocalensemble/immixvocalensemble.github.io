> **What is your artistic training and background?**

I played the violin and later the viola from my early youth. I started singing in university and then studied classical singing in Utrecht and The Hague.

> **What is you most memorable artistic experience?**

Singing the solo baritone part in Sun Dogs by Ēriks Ešenvalds with other ensemble singing students. It was such an honor to sing and the artistic quality was exactly where I wanted it to give me chills each concert.

> **Immix Vocal Ensemble sprung out from NKK NXT, a traineeship organized by the Nederlands Kamerkoor where young singers explore what choir singing is about by creating and producing their own performance. Why did you want to be a part of this program?**

I wanted to see where innovation in ensemble singing could be found that’s more than simply adding staging to what is otherwise a regular choir performance.

> **What is your superpower in Immix Vocal Ensemble?**

I am the local modern music enthusiast, finding charm and appeal in the strangest of places.
