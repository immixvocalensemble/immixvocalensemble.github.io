> **What is your artistic training and background?**

I am a classical singer with countless years as a chorister; from National Children’s Choir of Great Britain, National Youth Choir, into lay clerkships at Cathedrals as an adult and becoming a scholar with the BBC National Chorus of Wales. My training is in Classical Vocal Performance and Opera as a Mezzo Soprano, obtaining my BMus with Honors. At present I am continuing my Masters education training as a soloist alongside engagements with de Nationale Opera en Ballet and IMMIX Vocal Ensemble.<br><br>

> **What is you most memorable artistic experience?**

A memory which remains with me takes place in Venice, whilst touring with a choir. Our conductor had arranged for us to perform twice in the Basilica di San Marco, one of which was in the organ loft with the masterpiece of gold artwork overhead. Unforgettable. <br><br>

> **Immix Vocal Ensemble sprung out from NKK NXT, a traineeship organized by the Nederlands Kamerkoor where young singers explore what choir singing is about by creating and producing their own performance. Why did you want to be a part of this program?**

I applied to the Nederland Kamerkoor’s NXT programme to step out of the role of performer and indulge in the workings behind making a production. Being informed about the mechanics and experimentation which comes before the performance takes form is really fascinating and enjoyable. Oftentimes as a performer the decisions have been made in advance, with this traineeship we were given the freedom to explore. <br><br>

> **What is your superpower in Immix Vocal Ensemble?**

We work in the ensemble to create honest storytelling and captivate our audiences, I think my superpower is bringing in an honest narrative to our repertoire.
